Page Set: Choose "All Pages", "Even Pages" or "Odd Pages" if you want to print a page selection matching one of these terms. The default is "All Pages". Note: If you combine a selection of a "Page Range" with a "Page Set" of "Odd" or "Even", you will only get the odd or even pages from the originally selected page range. This is useful if you want to print a page range in duplex on a simplex-only printer. In this case you can feed the paper to the printer twice; in the first pass, select "Odd" or "Even" (depending on your printer model), in second pass select the other option. You may need to "Reverse" the output in one of the passes (depending on your printer model). Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-set=... # example: "odd" or "even"

This is a shell script that grabs a frame of video from the system's video input, and then uses some PBM filters (chosen at random) to manipulate and recombine the video frame in various ways (edge detection, subtracting the image from a rotated version of itself, etc.) Then it displays that image for a few seconds, and does it again. This works really well if you just feed broadcast television into it. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1998.

Invitations are normally sent as attachments to a mail. This switch changes the invitation mails to be sent in the text of the mail instead; this is necessary to send invitations and replies to Microsoft Outlook. But, when you do this, you no longer get descriptive text that mail programs can read; so, to people who have email programs that do not understand the invitations, the resulting messages look very odd. People that have email programs that do understand invitations will still be able to work with this.

This list should show the types of file that your application can handle. This list is organized by mimetypes. MIME, Multipurpose Internet (e)Mail Extension, is a standard protocol for identifying the type of data based on filename extensions and correspondent mimetypes. Example: the "bmp" part that comes after the dot in flower. bmp indicates that it is a specific kind of image, image/ x-bmp. To know which application should open each type of file, the system should be informed about the abilities of each application to handle these extensions and mimetypes. If you want to associate this application with one or more mimetypes that are not in this list, click on the button Add below. If there are one or more filetypes that this application cannot handle, you may want to remove them from the list clicking on the button Remove below.

If [defaultvalue] is present, it means that if the attribute is not present in the tag it is taken as present with value = defaultvalue. Example: Tags=style(type[text/ css]) means that both lt; stylegt; and lt; stylenbsp; type="text/ css"gt; are treated the same way and the DTEP defined by this tag is named text/ css.

Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Tangram (Chinese: literally "seven boards of cunning") is a Chinese puzzle. While the tangram is often said to be ancient, its existence has only been verified as far back as 1800. It consists of 7 pieces, called tans, which fit together to form a square; taking the square as the unit: \t* 5 right isosceles triangles \t\to 2 small (legs of 1) \t\to 1 medium size (legs of square root of 2) \t\to 2 large size (legs of 2) \t* 1 square (side of 1) \t* 1 parallelogram (sides of 1 and square root of 2)

Top Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the top margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-top=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.

Move ultra-quickly to trap the two enemies and run over them. If you wait till they are almost touching you, they may both survive, then you can run up and around to the bottom right, descend the ladder to the concrete and trap them permanently in the nearby pit. If one gets stuck in the tower structure, use the same trick. There are false bricks in the bottom of the tower. If one is trapped and still has some gold, dig one hole at the right hand end of the pit, go back down the ladder and lead the enemy to his death, whereupon the gold will be destroyed.

If you are missing a real printer, you need to...... either create a local printer with the help of the KDE Add Printer Wizard. The Wizard is available for the CUPS and RLPR printing systems (click button to the left of the'Properties' button),... or try to connect to an existing remote CUPS print server. You can connect by clicking the'System Options' button below. A new dialog opens: click on the'CUPS server 'icon: Fill in the information required to use the remote server. Note: It may happen that you successfully connected to a remote CUPS server and still do not get a printer list. If this happens: force KDEPrint to re-load its configuration files. To reload the configuration files, either start kprinter again, or switch the print system away from CUPS and back again once. The print system switch can be made through a selection in the drop-down menu at bottom of this dialog when fully expanded).

The monster is made almost completely of false bricks. Analyze the concrete parts of his body, to determine where to fall and where not to fall. All four enemies will have to be trapped above particular concrete pieces, to enable you to reach certain gold pieces. Trap the enemies by using KGoldrunner rules to your advantage. Wait on the top pole at the point where you want the enemy to fall. As he approaches you, fall onto a lower pole and move left or right to avoid the enemy's fate. This is how he falls into danger while you fall to safety.

Using Links in Tomboy Notes in Tomboy can be linked together by highlighting text in the current note and clicking the Link button above in the toolbar. Doing so will create a new note and also underline the note's title in the current note. Changing the title of a note will update links present in other notes. This prevents broken links from occurring when a note is renamed. Also, if you type the name of another note in your current note, it will automatically be linked for you.

SIMTABLE returns one of the values in the given argument list depending on the round number of the simulation tool. When the simulation tool is not activated, SIMTABLE returns @{d1}. With the simulation tool and the SIMTABLE function you can test given decision variables. Each SIMTABLE function contains the possible values of a simulation variable. In most valid simulation models you should have the same number of values @{dN} for all decision variables. If the simulation is run more rounds than there are values defined, SIMTABLE returns #N/A! error (e.g. if A1 contains `=SIMTABLE(1)' and A2 `=SIMTABLE(1,2)', A1 yields #N/A! error on the second round). The successive use of the simulation tool also requires that you give to the tool at least one input variable having RAND() or any other RAND() function in it. On each round, the simulation tool iterates for the given number of rounds over all the input variables to reevaluate them. On each iteration, the values of the output variables are stored, and when the round is completed, descriptive statistical information is created according to the values.

The water jet pump has two entry pipes and one exit, and consists, in principle, of two pipes one inside the other. At the water entry a water jet shoots under full pressure out of a nozzle into a slightly larger pipe. The water jet thereby carries away air or fluid from the second entry. This is caused by the negative pressure in a drifting fluid, and thus it is an application of the hydrodynamic paradox (objects close to drifting fluids are aspirated instead of being pushed away).

The object of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent. Since the game has only 48 seeds, capturing 25 is sufficient to accomplish this. Since there are an even number of seeds, it is possible for the game to end in a draw, where each player has captured 24. The game is over when one player has captured 25 or more seeds, or both players have taken 24 seeds each (draw). If both players agree that the game has been reduced to an endless cycle, each player captures the seeds on their side of the board.

If you check this box, only the first letter will be written if the letter is found in several places in the word. Then you have to rechoose the same letter, to replace the second instance in the word until there are no more instances of this letter. For example, the word to guess is "potato". If this option is unchecked, when you try "o", the two instances of "o" in the word will be discovered at the same time. If this is checked, you will need to try "o" twice. Default is that for one letter typed, all instances of that letter in the word are discovered.

To check whether your POP3 server announces pipelining support use the "Check What the Server Supports" button at the bottom of the Security tab in this dialog; if your server does not announce it, but you want more speed, then you should do some testing first by sending yourself a batch of mail and downloading it.

This area contains a CIE or chromaticity diagram. A CIE diagram is a representation of all the colors that a person with normal vision can see. This is represented by the colored sail-shaped area. In addition you will see a triangle that is superimposed on the diagram outlined in white. This triangle represents the outer boundaries of the color space of the device that is characterized by the inspected profile. This is called the device gamut. In addition there are black dots and yellow lines on the diagram. Each black dot represents one of the measurement points that were used to create this profile. The yellow line represents the amount that each point is corrected by the profile, and the direction of this correction.

Saturation: Slider to control the saturation value for all colors used. The saturation value adjusts the saturation of the colors in an image, similar to the color knob on your television. The color saturation value can range from 0 to 200. On inkjet printers, a higher saturation value uses more ink. On laserjet printers, a higher saturation uses more toner. A color saturation of 0 produces a black-and-white print, while a value of 200 will make the colors extremely intense. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o saturation=... # use range from "0" to "200"

You can hide the cell content with Hide all and again this needs sheet protection. You can learn more about all these settings in the User Manual in the Advanced KSpread chapter.

At the beginning of the game four seeds are placed in each house. Players take turns moving the seeds. In each turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under his or her control. The player removes all seeds from this house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from the original house, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. That is, the starting house is left empty; if it contained 12 seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. After a turn, if the last seed was placed into an opponent's house and brought its total to two or three, all the seeds in that house are captured and placed in the player's scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). If the previous-to-last seed also brought the total seeds in an opponent's house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on. However, if a move would capture all an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited, and the seeds are instead left on the board, since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game. The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in his/her own territory, ending the game. (Source Wikipedia &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owaregt;)

Note 1: To print HP-GL files, start'kprinter 'and simply load the file into the running kprinter. Note 2: The'fitplot' parameter provided on this dialog also works for printing PDF files (if your CUPS version is more recent than 1.1.22.) Additional hint for power users: These KDEPrint GUI elements correspond to the CUPS command line job option parameters: -o blackplot=... # examples: "true" or "false" -o fitplot=... # examples: "true" or "false" -o penwidth=... # examples: "true" or "false"

Service Manager This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, there are two types of service: Services invoked at startup Services called on demand The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup services can be started and stopped. In Administrator mode, you can also define whether services should be loaded at startup. Use this with care: some services are vital for KDE; do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing.

This option allows you to change the relationship between the distance that the mouse pointer moves on the screen and the relative movement of the physical device itself (which may be a mouse, trackball, or some other pointing device.) A high value for the acceleration will lead to large movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a small movement with the physical device. Selecting very high values may result in the mouse pointer flying across the screen, making it hard to control.

No hide This option is based on the option of the same name provided in IRIX NFS. Normally, if a server exports two filesystems one of which is mounted on the other, then the client will have to mount both filesystems explicitly to get access to them. If it just mounts the parent, it will see an empty directory at the place where the other filesystem is mounted. That filesystem is "hidden". Setting the nohide option on a filesystem causes it not to be hidden, and an appropriately authorized client will be able to move from the parent to that filesystem without noticing the change. However, some NFS clients do not cope well with this situation as, for instance, it is then possible for two files in the one apparent filesystem to have the same inode number. The nohide option is currently only effective on single host exports. It does not work reliably with netgroup, subnet, or wildcard exports. This option can be very useful in some situations, but it should be used with due care, and only after confirming that the client system copes with the situation effectively.

Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1. For example, 3 is a prime number, but 4 isn't (because 4 is divisible by 2). You can think of prime numbers as very small families: they only ever have two people in them! Only themselves and 1. You can't fit any other numbers into them with nothing left over. 5 is one of these lonely numbers (only 5 × 1 = 5), but you can see that 6 has 2 and 3 in its family as well (6 × 1 = 6, 2 × 3 = 6). So 6 is not a prime number. Use the arrow keys to navigate around the board and to avoid the Troggles. Press the spacebar to eat a number.

You have to kill all three Musketeers, so that they fill the false bricks under the gap in the bars at the top. Ignore d'Artagnan at the bottom right. You only walk over him to get a nugget. Collect the gold left to right across the bottom of the play area, then right to left across the top. Be sure to leave the nugget left of centre on the concrete. Collect that one last. Before you do so, dig away a row of three bricks above and to the left of it, then exit to the next level along roughly the same route as you used earlier.

Image Size: Drop-down menu to control the image size on the printed paper. The menu works in conjunction with slider below. The options are: Natural Image Size: Image prints in its natural image size. If it does not fit onto one sheet, the printout will be spread across multiple sheets. Note, that the slider is disabled when selecting'natural image size 'in the dropdown menu. Resolution (ppi): The resolution value slider covers a number range from 1 to 1200. It specifies the resolution of the image in Pixels Per Inch (PPI). An image that is 3000x2400 pixels will print 10x8 inches at 300 pixels per inch, for example, but 5x4 inches at 600 pixels per inch. If the specified resolution makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed. Resolution defaults to 72 ppi.% of Page Size: The percent value slider covers numbers from 1 to 800. It specifies the size in relation to the page (not the image). A scaling of 100 percent will fill the page as completely as the image aspect ratio allows (doing auto-rotation of the image as needed). A scaling of more than 100 will print the image across multiple sheets. A scaling of 200 percent will print on up to 4 pages. Scaling in% of page size defaults to 100%.% of Natural Image Size: The percent value slider moves from 1 to 800. It specifies the printout size in relation to the natural image size. A scaling of 100 percent will print the image at its natural size, while a scaling of 50 percent will print the image at half its natural size. If the specified scaling makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed. Scaling in% of natural image size defaults to 100%. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o natural-scaling=... # range in% is 1... .800 -o scaling=... # range in% is 1... .800 -o ppi=... # range in ppi is 1... 1200

Paper Size This field indicates the paper size the poster tiles will be printed on. To select a different paper size for your poster tiles, go to the'General 'tab of this dialog and select one from the drop-down list. Available sizes are most standard paper sizes supported by your printer. Your printer's supported paper sizes are read from the printer driver info (as laid down in the'PPD', the printer description file.) Be aware that the'Paper Size 'selected may not be supported by'poster' (example: 'HalfLetter ') while it may well be supported by your printer. If you hit that obstacle, simply use another, supported Paper Size, such as'A4' or'Letter '. Notice, how the little preview window below changes with your change of paper size. It indicates how many tiles need to be printed to make up the poster, given the selected paper and poster size. Hint: The little preview window below is not just a passive icon. You can click on its individual tiles to select them for printing. To select multiple tiles to be printed at once, you need to'shift-click' on the tiles ('shift-click 'means: hold down the [SHIFT]-key on your keyboard and click with the mouse while [SHIFT]-key is held.) The order in which you click dictates the order in which the tiles are printed. The order of your selection (and for the printed tiles) is indicated by the contents of the text field labelled as'Tile pages (to be printed):' Note: By default, no tiles are selected. Before you can print (a part of) your poster, you must select at least one tile.

Name / Address field Here you can enter the host name or address. The host may be specified in a number of ways: single host This is the most common format. You may specify a host either by an abbreviated name recognized by the resolver, the fully qualified domain name, or an IP address. netgroups NIS netgroups may be given as @group. Only the host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking for membership. Empty host parts or those containing a single dash (-) are ignored. wildcards Machine names may contain the wildcard characters * and?. This can be used to make the exports file more compact; for instance, *. cs. foo. edu matches all hosts in the domain cs. foo. edu. However, these wildcard characters do not match the dots in a domain name, so the above pattern does not include hosts such as a. b. cs. foo. edu. IP networks You can also export directories to all hosts on an IP (sub-) network simultaneously. This is done by specifying an IP address and netmask pair as address/ netmask where the netmask can be specified in dotted-decimal format, or as a contiguous mask length (for example, either ` / 255.255.252.0 'or ` / 22' appended to the network base address result in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host).

Call Graph around active Function Depending on configuration, this view shows the call graph environment of the active function. Note: the shown cost is only the cost which is spent while the active function was actually running; i. e. the cost shown for main() - if it is visible - should be the same as the cost of the active function, as that is the part of inclusive cost of main() spent while the active function was running. For cycles, blue call arrows indicate that this is an artificial call added for correct drawing which actually never happened. If the graph is larger than the widget area, an overview panner is shown in one edge. There are similar visualization options to the Call Treemap; the selected function is highlighted.

This displays 2D projections of the sequence of 3D objects which are the projections of the 4D analog to the cube: as a square is composed of four lines, each touching two others; and a cube is composed of six squares, each touching four others; a hypercube is composed of eight cubes, each touching six others. To make it easier to visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of each face. Do n't think about it too long, or your brain will melt. See also "polytopes" for a more general version of this using OpenGL. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Hypercube http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Regularpolytope Written by Joe Keane, Fritz Mueller, and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.
Print Preview Enable this checkbox if you want to see a preview of your printout. A preview lets you check if, for instance, your intended "poster" or "pamphlet" layout looks like you expected, without wasting paper first. It also lets you cancel the job if something looks wrong. Note: The preview feature (and therefore this checkbox) is only visible for printjobs created from inside KDE applications. If you start kprinter from the commandline, or if you use kprinter as a print command for non-KDE applications (like Acrobat Reader, Firefox or OpenOffice), print preview is not available here.

Setup proxy configuration. A proxy server is an intermediate machine that sits between your computer and the Internet and provides services such as web page caching and filtering. Caching proxy servers give you faster access to web sites you have already visited by locally storing or caching those pages; filtering proxy servers usually provide the ability to block out requests for ads, spam, or anything else you want to block. If you are uncertain whether or not you need to use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, consult your Internet service provider's setup guide or your system administrator.

Additionally, a passphrase can contain spaces, meaning it can contain many words. You should pick a phrase that is easy to rememeber and contains punctuation. Take this phrase, adjust the case of various letters, and change some of the letters into numbers or punctuation, reminiscent of "leet speak", but don't make it so obscure to the point where you can't remember it.

Bottom Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the bottom margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-bottom=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.

You can see some cards, but you can't see what's on the other side of them. Each card is hiding an adding-up sum, or the answer to the sum. An adding-up sum looks like this: 2 + 2 = 4 The numbers on one side of the equals sign (=) have to be the same as the number on the other side. So 2 (1, 2) and 2 more (3, 4) makes 4. Count aloud when you work this out, and count on your fingers, because the more ways you do something, the better you remember it. You can also use blocks, or buttons, or anything you can count. If you have lots of brothers and sisters, you can count them! Or the kids in your class at school. Sing counting songs. Count lots of things, for practice, and you'll be very good at adding-up! In this game, these cards are hiding the two parts of an adding-up sum (also called an addition sum). You need to find the two parts of the sum, and bring them together again. Click on a card to see what number it's hiding, then try to find the other card that goes with it, to make a whole sum. You can only turn over two cards in one go, so you need to remember where the numbers are hiding, then you can match them when you find their other half. You're doing the job of the equals sign, and the numbers need you to put them together and make a proper sum. When you do that, both those cards disappear! When you've made them all disappear, found all the sums, you've won the game! :)

Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP is used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap file is created on a folder that is mounted over NFS. For these reasons, it may be desirable to put your swap file in "/tmp".

There is no valid reason to load images off the Internet like this, since the sender can always attach the required images directly to the message. To guard from such a misuse of the HTML displaying feature of KMail, this option is disabled by default. However, if you wish to, for example, view images in HTML messages that were not attached to it, you can enable this option, but you should be aware of the possible problem.

Preview Options Here you can modify the behavior of Konqueror when it shows the files in a folder. The list of protocols: check the protocols over which previews should be shown; uncheck those over which they should not. For instance, you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough, but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images. Maximum File Size: select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated. For instance, if set to 1 MB (the default), no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB, for speed reasons.

Go anti-clockwise around the circuit and take an enemy with you, trapping him in the pits at bottom left, lower right and upper right. Then you can run across the concrete and collect the gold up there. Next, clear out all of the left side except for one nugget above a ladder. To get this one, release the second enemy and take him all the way around the circuit. Follow him up the long ladder, staying on it till he runs over to the left and falls. Now go to the left end of the concrete as he circulates around the left side of the play area. As he falls past your feet, run over to the small ladder and get the gold. To get past the lower left pit, stand on the enemy and dig left. When you fall, dig right and escape, but stay low until the bricks close, then you can use the short ladder to lead the enemy up, across, down and out. To operate the lower right pit, go and get the gold in the centre of the circuit, then dig each side of the short ladder there. Fall to the left as the enemy is caught on the right. When the enemy emerges, he will go right and drop into the pit. Stand on his head and dig left to release him. You can push the enemy up the right hand ladder and to the left by standing a little way from the bottom of the ladder. You will need careful timing and digging to get him into the top right pit. Once there, you can run over him. If he still has gold, stand to the left of the pit and dig repeatedly until he drops the gold somewhere on his rounds.

This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. So you might want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie, allowing you to decide. For your favorite shopping web sites that you trust, you might want to set the policy to accept, then you can access the web sites without being prompted every time KDE receives a cookie.

A rotary evaporator consists of a round flask in a bath of hot water, and is designed to evaporate solvents. The flask is rotated and the solvent collects under a vacuum onto a condenser and drips into a condensate collecting flask. In this way solutions can be concentrated or purified. By attaching a vacuum pump, the air pressure and therefore the boiling point of the fluid can be decreased.

Failed to get lock using fcntl(2):
Perceptual intent causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or expanded to fill the gamut of the destination media, so that gray balance is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the image to be adjusted so that every color in the image falls within the range that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of photographs and images, and is the default intent. Absolute Colorimetric intent causes any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This intent preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,...). Relative Colorimetric intent is defined such that any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render are adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. Proof intent does not preserve the white point. Saturation intent preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and contrast well with each other rather than a specific color.

Burets are used to titrate liquids. A buret is filled with a specific volume of a liquid, and placed beneath it is a container such as an Erlenmeyer flask. By opening the valve on the buret, the liquid in the container will then be titrated. High-quality burets have a venting mechanism with which they can be very easily refilled with the exact volume for which the buret is calibrated.

If true, then Metacity works in terms of applications rather than windows. The concept is a bit abstract, but in general an application-based setup is more like the Mac and less like Windows. When you focus a window in application-based mode, all the windows in the application will be raised. Also, in application-based mode, focus clicks are not passed through to windows in other applications. Application-based mode is, however, largely unimplemented at the moment.

Profile Dumps This dockable shows in the top part the list of loadable profile dumps in all subdirectories of: current working directory of KCachegrind, i. e. where it was started from, and the default profile dump directory given in the configuration. The list is sorted according to the target command profiled in the corresponding dump. On selecting a profile dump, information for it is shown in the bottom area of the dockable: Options allows you to view the profiled command and profile options of this dump. By changing any item, a new (yet unexisting) profile template is created. Press Run Profile to start a profile run with these options in the background. Info gives detailed info on the selected dump like event cost summary and properties of the simulated cache. State is only available for current happening profiles runs. Press Update to see different counters of the run, and a stack trace of the current position in the program profiled. Check the Every option to let KCachegrind regularly poll these data. Check the Sync option to let the dockable activate the top function in the current loaded dump.

The top of this one is similar to the Head Case level (13). Trap the enemy to the right near the top of the ladder. Run down the ladder part way and get him to fall into the first of the pits. You will need to repeat this a few times. Now you must get the enemy into the pit at the far bottom left, so that you can run over him as you get the gold from inside the beetle. Trap the enemy at the end of the row of bricks under the beetle's antennae. Stand on his head, dig right and drop down. Step right, dig left and trap him again as he runs in after you. Run down to the left, dig the brick to the right of the pit and trap him again. Collect the nugget, dig left and escape left onto the concrete. As the enemy climbs out he will fall into the pit.

At top centre dig two bricks. As they re-appear, dig two more, run across the top and dig next to the short ladder. Drop in and collect the gold. You have no time to spare! Clear the bottom left last. To go right, fall into a false brick under a short ladder, then climb along just under the concrete. In the middle of the right hand side, stand under the right hand bar next to the hole, dig left, drop into a false brick, then dig twice more, moving down and left. Lastly, stand on the short ladder, dig your escape brick on the right, run like mad round to the hole, drop in, collect the gold, fall through some bricks and dig again to escape.

The fraction format changes your number into a fraction. For example, 0.1 can be changed to 1/ 8, 2/ 16, 1/ 10, etc. You define the type of fraction by choosing it in the field on the right. If the exact fraction is not possible in the fraction mode you choose, the nearest closest match is chosen. For example: when we have 1.5 as number, we choose Fraction and Sixteenths 1/ 16 the text displayed into cell is "1 8/ 16" which is an exact fraction. If you have 1.4 as number in your cell and you choose Fraction and Sixteenths 1/ 16 then the cell will display "1 6/ 16" which is the nearest closest Sixteenth fraction.

You can see some cards, but you can't see what's on the other side of them. Each card is hiding a subtraction, or the answer to it. A subtraction looks like this: 3 - 1 = 2 The numbers on one side of the equals sign (=) have to be the same as the number on the other side. So 3 (1, 2, 3) less 1 (1) makes 2. Count aloud when you work this out, and count on your fingers, because the more ways you do something, the better you remember it. You can also use blocks, or buttons, or anything you can count. If you have lots of brothers and sisters, you can count them! Or the kids in your class at school. Sing counting songs. Count lots of things, for practice, and you'll be very good at subtracting numbers! In this game, these cards are hiding the two parts of a subtraction. You need to find the two parts of the subtraction, and bring them together again. Click on a card to see what number it's hiding, then try to find the other card that goes with it, to make a whole difference. You can only turn over two cards in one go, so you need to remember where the numbers are hiding, then you can match them when you find their other half. You're doing the job of the equals sign, and the numbers need you to put them together and make a proper difference. When you do that, both those cards disappear! When you've made them all disappear, found all the subtracts, you've won the game! :)

The image to be pasted may have more colors than the current screen mode can support. In order to display it, some color information may be removed. If you save this image, any color loss will become permanent. To avoid this issue, increase your screen depth to at least bpp and then restart KolourPaint. It also contains translucency which is not fully supported. The translucency data will be approximated with a 1-bit transparency mask.

For example, on a "top" panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a "bottom" panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.

File Associations This module allows you to choose which applications are associated with a given type of file. File types are also referred to as MIME types (MIME is an acronym which stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"). A file association consists of the following: Rules for determining the MIME-type of a file, for example the filename pattern *. png, which means'all files with names that end in. png ', is associated with the MIME type "image/ png"; A short description of the MIME-type, for example the description of the MIME type "image/ png" is simply'PNG image'; An icon to be used for displaying files of the given MIME-type, so that you can easily identify the type of file in a file manager or file-selection dialog (at least for the types you use often); A list of the applications which can be used to open files of the given MIME-type -- if more than one application can be used then the list is ordered by priority. You may be surprised to find that some MIME types have no associated filename patterns; in these cases, KDE is able to determine the MIME-type by directly examining the contents of the file.

Enables the start of dynamically wrapped lines to be aligned vertically to the indentation level of the first line. This can help to make code and markup more readable. Additionally, this allows you to set a maximum width of the screen, as a percentage, after which dynamically wrapped lines will no longer be vertically aligned. For example, at 50%, lines whose indentation levels are deeper than 50% of the width of the screen will not have vertical alignment applied to subsequent wrapped lines.

Perceptual intent causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or expanded to fill the gamut of the destination device, so that gray balance is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the image to be adjusted so that the every color in the image falls within the range that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of photographs and images, and is the default intent. Absolute Colorimetric intent causes any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This intent preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,....) Relative Colorimetric intent is defined such that any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render are adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. Proof intent does not preserve the white point. Saturation intent preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and contrast well with each other rather than a specific color.

It looks as though you should trap two enemies in the two pits at the bottom. Try it, but it is very hard to get one into the right hand pit and you are apt to get an enemy with gold in the left hand pit. Four false bricks further left prevent you running over from the left and digging. It is best to pick up the bottom row of gold last, dropping in via the hanging nugget at the right and escaping via the ladder that appears. The key to clearing up the left hand section is the line of ladders embedded in the bricks. Exit via the three places that have false bricks beneath them. It is suicide to drop onto the middle of the T-shaped bricks. Start by collecting the gold on the right of the T: then you can get an enemy to run into the U-shaped pit. Watch out for the false brick in the middle of the platform at the lower left. You have to collect the gold in separate trips from the left and the right.

Windows Shares Konqueror is able to access shared Microsoft Windows file systems, if properly configured. If there is a specific computer from which you want to browse, fill in the Browse server field. This is mandatory if you are not running Samba locally. The Broadcast address and WINS address fields will also be available, if you use the native code, or the location of the'smb. conf 'file from which the options are read, when using Samba. In any case, the broadcast address (interfaces in smb. conf) must be set up if it is guessed incorrectly or you have multiple cards. A WINS server usually improves performance, and reduces the network load a lot. The bindings are used to assign a default user for a given server, possibly with the corresponding password, or for accessing specific shares. If you choose to, new bindings will be created for logins and shares accessed during browsing. You can edit all of them from here. Passwords will be stored locally, and scrambled so as to render them unreadable to the human eye. For security reasons, you may not want to do that, as entries with passwords are clearly indicated as such.

This transformation may introduce small image distortions along one or more edges, because the image dimensions are not multiples of 8. The distortion is reversible, however. If the resulting image is unacceptable, simply apply the reverse transformation to return to the original image. You can also choose to discard (or trim) any untransformable edge pixels. For practical use, this mode gives the best looking results, but the transformation is not strictly lossless anymore.

This generates random cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation.

Here you can get some assistance in setting up KMail's filter rules to use some commonly-known anti-virus tools. The wizard can detect those tools on your computer as well as create filter rules to classify messages using these tools and to separate messages containing viruses. The wizard will not take any existing filter rules into consideration: it will always append the new rules. Warning: As KMail appears to be frozen during the scan of the messages for viruses, you may encounter problems with the responsiveness of KMail because anti-virus tool operations are usually time consuming; please consider deleting the filter rules created by the wizard to get back to the former behavior.

Joystick This module helps to check if your joystick is working correctly. If it delivers wrong values for the axes, you can try to solve this with the calibration. This module tries to find all available joystick devices by checking / dev/ js[0-4] and / dev/ input/ js[0-4] If you have another device file, enter it in the combobox. The Buttons list shows the state of the buttons on your joystick, the Axes list shows the current value for all axes.

Here you should enter the IP address for the network interface. Please note: If your network is connected to the internet, you should only enter IP addresses you have been given by your provider. Otherwise, you should enter one of the IP addresses which are explicitly reserved for private use. Most small private networks use class C networks, which allow up to 255 computers in your network. So simply use addresses like 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.171 and so on for your computers. Class C networks: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255, for example 192.168.0.13. Class B networks: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, for example 172.28.2.5 Class A networks: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, for example 10.5.12.14 Please ensure that all IP addresses you give to your computers are unique; you will have many problems if the same address is assigned to more than one network device.

Filtering Chain (if enabled, is run before actual job submission to print system.) This field shows which filters are currently selected to act as'pre-filters' for KDEPrint. Pre-filters process the print files before they are sent down-stream to your real print subsystem. The list shown in this field may be empty (default). The pre-filters act on the print job in the order they are listed (from top to bottom). This is done by acting as a filtering chain where the output of one filter acts as input to the next. By putting the filters into the wrong order, you can make the filtering chain fail. For example: if your file is ASCII text, and you want the output being processed by the'Multipage per Sheet 'filter, the first filter must be one that converts ASCII into PostScript. KDEPrint can utilize any external filtering program which you may find useful through this interface. KDEPrint ships preconfigured with support for a selection of common filters. These filters however need to be installed independently from KDEPrint. These pre-filters work for all print subsystems supported by KDEPrint (such as CUPS, LPRng and LPD), because they are not dependent upon them.. Amongst the pre-configured filters shipping with KDEPrint are: the Enscript text filter; a Multiple Pages per Sheet filter; a PostScript to PDF converter; a Page Selection/ Ordering filter; a Poster Printing filter; and some more.... To insert a filter into this list, simply click on the funnel icon (top-most on the right icon column group) and proceed. Please click on the other elements of this dialog to learn more about the KDEPrint pre-filters.

It supports many styles of generation from fully automated to functional replacements for dpkg-scanpackages and dpkg-scansources apt-ftparchive generates Package files from a tree of .debs. The Package file contains the contents of all the control fields from each package as well as the MD5 hash and filesize. An override file is supported to force the value of Priority and Section. Similarly apt-ftparchive generates Sources files from a tree of .dscs. The --source-override option can be used to specify a src override file The 'packages' and 'sources' command should be run in the root of the tree. BinaryPath should point to the base of the recursive search and override file should contain the override flags. Pathprefix is appended to the filename fields if present.

The focus policy is used to determine the active window, i. e. the window you can work in. Click to focus: A window becomes active when you click into it. This is the behavior you might know from other operating systems. Focus follows mouse: Moving the mouse pointer actively on to a normal window activates it. New windows will receive the focus, without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly. Very practical if you are using the mouse a lot. Focus under mouse: The window that happens to be under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, the last window that was under the mouse has focus. New windows will not automatically receive the focus. Focus strictly under mouse: Only the window under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, nothing has focus. Note that'Focus under mouse 'and'Focus strictly under mouse' prevent certain features such as the Alt+Tab walk through windows dialog in the KDE mode from working properly.

Now you have to dig to get the gold! Just use the left and right mouse buttons to dig left or right of the hero's position. The hero can then jump into and through the hole he has dug. He can also dig several holes in a row and run sideways through the dug holes. Be careful though. After a while the holes close up and you can get trapped and killed. In the third box down, you have to dig two holes, jump in and quickly dig one more, to get through two layers. On the right, you have to dig three, then two then one to get through. There are also two little puzzles to work out along the way. Good luck! By the way, you can dig through brick, but not concrete.

If you have a TFT or LCD screen you can further improve the quality of displayed fonts by selecting this option. Sub-pixel rendering is also known as ClearType(tm). In order for sub-pixel rendering to work correctly you need to know how the sub-pixels of your display are aligned. On TFT or LCD displays a single pixel is actually composed of three sub-pixels, red, green and blue. Most displays have a linear ordering of RGB sub-pixel, some have BGR. This feature does not work with CRT monitors.

Job Priority Usually CUPS prints all jobs per queue according to the "FIFO" principle: First In, First Out. The job priority option allows you to re-order the queue according to your needs. It works in both directions: you can increase as well as decrease priorities. (Usually you can only control your own jobs.) Since the default job priority is "50", any job sent with, for example, "49" will be printed only after all those others have finished. Conversely, a "51" or higher priority job will go right to the top of a populated queue (if no other, higher prioritized one is present.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-priority=... # example: "10" or "66" or "99"

Once you've completed a drawing, you can select a new frame to work on by selecting one of the small rectangles on the bottom. Each frame contains the same content as its previous one. You can then edit it by moving objects a little bit or adding/deleting objects.

Scale Print Image to Page Size The'fitplot 'option specifies that the HP-GL image should be scaled to fill exactly the page with the (elsewhere selected) media size. The default is'fitplot is disabled'. The default will therefore use the absolute distances specified in the plot file. (You should be aware that HP-GL files are very often CAD drawings intended for large format plotters. On standard office printers they will therefore lead to the drawing printout being spread across multiple pages.) Note: This feature depends upon an accurate plot size (PS) command in the HP-GL/ 2 file. If no plot size is given in the file the filter converting the HP-GL to PostScript assumes the plot is ANSI E size. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o fitplot=true

Setting this option to false can lead to buggy behavior, so users are strongly discouraged from changing it from the default of true. Many actions (e.g. clicking in the client area, moving or resizing the window) normally raise the window as a side-effect. Setting this option to false, which is strongly discouraged, will decouple raising from other user actions, and ignore raise requests generated by applications. See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/showbug.cgi?id=445447#c6. Even when this option is false, windows can still be raised by an alt-left-click anywhere on the window, a normal click on the window decorations, or by special messages from pagers, such as activation requests from tasklist applets. This option is currently disabled in click-to-focus mode. Note that the list of ways to raise windows when raiseonclick is false does not include programmatic requests from applications to raise windows; such requests will be ignored regardless of the reason for the request. If you are an application developer and have a user complaining that your application does not work with this setting disabled, tell them it is their fault for breaking their window manager and that they need to change this option back to true or live with the "bug" they requested.

Here you can choose to Simple Search directly or to use some keywords to specify some attributes, such as the artist name and so on. The keywords selectable are divided by their specific value. Some keywords are numeric and others are alphanumeric. You do not need to know it directly. When a keyword is numeric it will be used to search the numeric data for each track. The alphanumeric keywords are the following: album, artist, filename (including path), mountpoint (e. g. / home/ user1), filetype (you can specify mp3, ogg, flac,... and the file extensions will be matched), genre, comment, composer, directory, lyrics, title, and label. The numeric keywords are: bitrate, disc/ discnumber, length (expressed in seconds), playcount, rating, samplerate, score, size/ filesize (expressed in bytes, kbytes, and megabytes as specified in the unit for the filesize keyword), track (i. e. the track number), and year.

Insecure locks This option tells the NFS server not to require authentication of locking requests (i. e. requests which use the NLM protocol). Normally the NFS server will require a lock request to hold a credential for a user who has read access to the file. With this flag no access checks will be performed. Early NFS client implementations did not send credentials with lock requests, and many current NFS clients still exist which are based on the old implementations. Use this flag if you find that you can only lock files which are world readable.

This setting defines which users sharing this folder should get "busy" periods in their freebusy lists and should see the alarms for the events or tasks in this folder. The setting applies to Calendar and Task folders only (for tasks, this setting is only used for alarms). Example use cases: if the boss shares a folder with his secretary, only the boss should be marked as busy for his meetings, so he should select "Admins", since the secretary has no admin rights on the folder. On the other hand if a working group shares a Calendar for group meetings, all readers of the folders should be marked as busy for meetings. A company-wide folder with optional events in it would use "Nobody" since it is not known who will go to those events.

During startup KDE needs to perform a check of its system configuration (mimetypes, installed applications, etc.), and in case the configuration has changed since the last time, the system configuration cache (KSyCoCa) needs to be updated. This option delays the check, which avoid scanning all directories containing files describing the system during KDE startup, thus making KDE startup faster. However, in the rare case the system configuration has changed since the last time, and the change is needed before this delayed check takes place, this option may lead to various problems (missing applications in the K Menu, reports from applications about missing required mimetypes, etc.). Changes of system configuration mostly happen by (un)installing applications. It is therefore recommended to turn this option temporarily off while (un)installing applications.

Scheduled Printing Scheduled printing lets you control the time of the actual printout, while you can still send away your job now and have it out of your way. Especially useful is the "Never (hold indefinitely)" option. It allows you to park your job until a time when you (or a printer administrator) decides to manually release it. This is often required in enterprise environments, where you normally are not allowed to directly and immediately access the huge production printers in your Central Repro Department. However it is okay to send jobs to the queue which is under the control of the operators (who, after all, need to make sure that the 10,000 sheets of pink paper which is required by the Marketing Department for a particular job are available and loaded into the paper trays.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-hold-until=... # example: "indefinite" or "no-hold"

While falling, dig left; run up ladder to gap and wait for enemy to fall in, escape, and fall in again to your dug brick; run up and left on pole, fall onto ledge while digging left, fall left, get gold, go right and fall into chamber while enemy spawns; get gold. You can dig into bottom chamber if you wish here. The other chambers are all accessible by dropping through fake brick tunnels. Dodge the enemies or fall on them to get the gold. To reach the right hand side, fall down the fake brick tunnel next to the central ladder and run fast to the right, digging behind you to trap the enemies. Collect the gold by going to the top and dropping through fake brick tunnels to the right of each piece.

No subtree check This option disables subtree checking, which has mild security implications, but can improve reliability is some circumstances. If a subdirectory of a filesystem is exported, but the whole filesystem is not, then whenever a NFS request arrives, the server must check not only that the accessed file is in the appropriate filesystem (which is easy) but also that it is in the exported tree (which is harder). This check is called the subtreecheck. In order to perform this check, the server must include some information about the location of the file in the "filehandle" that is given to the client. This can cause problems with accessing files that are renamed while a client has them open (though in many simple cases it will still work). subtree checking is also used to make sure that files inside directories to which only root has access can only be accessed if the filesystem is exported with norootsquash (see below), even the file itself allows more general access. As a general guide, a home directory filesystem, which is normally exported at the root and may see lots of file renames, should be exported with subtree checking disabled. A filesystem which is mostly read-only, and at least does not see many file renames (e. g. / usr or / var) and for which subdirectories may be exported, should probably be exported with subtree checks enabled.

The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. There is a legend about a Hindu temple whose priests were constantly engaged in moving a set of 64 discs according to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. According to the legend, the world would end when the priests finished their work. The puzzle is therefore also known as the Tower of Brahma puzzle. It is not clear whether Lucas invented this legend or was inspired by it. (source Wikipedia &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towerofhanoigt;)

Watchglasses are round glass panes with a diameter of around 5 - 10cm, used in various experimental techniques. The border is bent upwards to allow the watchglass to hold small amounts of liquids in order to let them evaporate. The evaporation can be accelerated by heating the watchglass with a Bunsen burner. Watchglasses can also be used to cover Petri dishes or beakers, and are also suited to weighing small amounts of matter or drying them in an airing cupboard. The term watchglass is derived from the former pocket watches' protection glass which was often domed.

The Parts Overview A trace consists of multiple trace parts when there are several profile data files from one profile run. The Trace Part Overview dockable shows these, horizontally ordered in execution time; the rectangle sizes are proportional to the total cost spent in the parts. You can select one or several parts to constrain all costs shown to these parts only. The parts are further subdivided: there is a partitioning and an callee split mode: Partitioning: You see the partitioning into groups for a trace part, according to the group type selected. E. g. if ELF object groups are selected, you see colored rectangles for each used ELF object (shared library or executable), sized according to the cost spent therein. Callee: A rectangle showing the inclusive cost of the current selected function in the trace part is shown. This is split up into smaller rectangles to show the costs of its callees.

An Erlenmeyer flask, named after the chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825-1909), is different to a beaker in that it comes with an inverted conical base and a cylindrical neck. There are different types of Erlenmeyer flasks for laboratory applications: the narrow neck and wide neck forms. Depending on the application the flask may have precision grinding to allow good connection to other containers. \t\t\t \t\t\tThe narrow neck reduces the risk of fluid escaping, especially when boiling or during reactions which agitate the contents. \t\t\t \t\t\tAn Erlenmeyer flask is useful for mixing fluids or accelerating reactions by stirring or shaking, for example. The Erlenmeyer flask is particularly suited for a magnetic stirrer, since it can be placed directly on the stirring platform. A round-bottomed flask, by contrast, must be placed on a cork ring on the stirring platform.

Fall on the enemy, dig below the gap on the right, then quickly go right, over his head. Pick up the gold, fall through a false brick, run up the ladder to the right and go to the right along the lower pole. Dig to the right (which traps the second enemy), get the gold, fall, dig left, fall, collect two gold pieces and go up two ladders. Move to the left via a false brick - the second enemy should still be trapped below. Go left to the ladder, down, then left and down through a false brick. Collect one gold, dig on the right, get three gold, dig and go up all the ladders on the right. Go left on the pole again, but this time climb upwards. Get one gold and dig right to trap another enemy. Move up to the top, go right, fall and continue to the concrete area at top center. Outwit the enemy in the concrete area, then exit by falling on him and moving to the gap on the left and down through two false bricks. Hold onto the pole at center screen, go right and back on up to the top. Move left on the pole and wait for the other enemy to enter the concrete area. Pick up the top gold, fall and exit left again, leaving two enemies trapped in the concrete. Go back up to the top again, but this time continue left towards the top-left corner of the screen. When you get up there, dig, fall through onto some gold and dig left twice while falling further. Now fall down the leftmost shaft and dig the brick that blocks the shaft. Wait for the enemy below to step into the shaft, then fall on him in order to collect the gold encased in concrete. Drop onto the remaining gold and fall to the bottom-left corner. Run right and up, right again, fall on three gold pieces and move on to the mid-bottom section. Outwit the enemy, go to the topmost ladder on the right, dig twice and fall through one gold and three bricks while digging right. Exit right to get more gold, then climb the ladder, dig and fall to collect another two gold pieces. Climb the ladder again, take the pole left, go up and then right to claim four gold pieces. Dig at the right-hand end and fall through three false bricks. Fall into the chamber, going right and digging left. Dig on the lower left to get out, then go back up to the pole and fall to onto the gold in this chamber. Exit right this time, collect some gold and climb up, up, up. Outwit the enemies in the upper-right area. It is possible to lure them into the chamber below by running ahead of them up the ladders. Collect the rightmost mid-level gold second to last and the gold at the bottom right last of all. Get out quick!

Hi! Welcome to KGoldrunner! The idea of the game is to pick up all the gold nuggets, then climb to the top of the playing area and move up to the next level. A hidden ladder will appear as you collect the last nugget. The hero, at the top left, is your deputy. To collect the nuggets, just point the mouse where you want him to go.

You can use \\{1}... \\{n} to specify certain words from the query and \\{name} to specify a value given by'name=value 'in the user query. In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once (\\{name1, name2,..., "string"}). The first matching value (from the left) will be used as the substitution value for the resulting URI. A quoted string can be used as the default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list.

Login Manager In this module you can configure the various aspects of the KDE Login Manager. This includes the look and feel as well as the users that can be selected for login. Note that you can only make changes if you run the module with superuser rights. If you have not started the KDE System Settings with superuser rights (which is absolutely the right thing to do, by the way), click on the Modify button to acquire superuser rights. You will be asked for the superuser password. General On this tab page, you can configure parts of the Login Manager's look, and which language it should use. The language settings made here have no influence on the user's language settings. Dialog Here you can configure the look of the "classical" dialog based mode if you have chosen to use it. Background If you want to set a special background for the dialog based login screen, this is where to do it. Themes Here you can specify a theme to be used by the Login Manager. Shutdown Here you can specify who is allowed to shutdown/ reboot the machine and whether a boot manager should be used. Users On this tab page, you can select which users the Login Manager will offer you for logging in. Convenience Here you can specify a user to be logged in automatically, users not needing to provide a password to log in, and other convenience features. Note, that these settings are security holes by their nature, so use them very carefully.

List of Driver Options (from PPD). The upper pane of this dialog page contains all print job options as laid down in the printer's description file (PostScript Printer Description == 'PPD '.) 
Click on any item in the list and watch the lower pane of this dialog page display the available values. Set the values as needed, then use one of the push buttons below to proceed: 'Save' your settings if you want to re-use them in your next job(s) too. 
'Save' will store your settings permanently until you change them again.. Click'OK' (without a prior click on'Save '), if you want to use your selected settings just once, for the next print job. 'OK' will forget your current settings when kprinter is closed again, and will start next time with the previously saved defaults. 
'Cancel 'will not change anything. If you proceed to print after clicking'Cancel', the job will print with the default settings of this queue. 
Note: The number of available job options depends strongly on the actual driver used for your print queue. 'Raw 'queues do not have a driver or a PPD. 
For raw queues this tab page is not loaded by KDEPrint, and thus is not present in the kprinter dialog.

Fall off the ledge, digging left to go left up the ladder. Continue left from the pole, then fall while digging left and collect some gold. Go right, fall through the false brick below the ladder, continue right and fall through a brick tunnel to the pole below. Head right and fall through another brick tunnel while digging right. Dig and trap the enemy, next to the ladder, run up and left then dig and fall to collect the gold. Dig to trap the enemy again. When the first hole fills, run up to the top of the section with the enemy following. Dig at the left to collect gold and fall back onto the pole. Now head left and fall through a brick tunnel, digging left to trap the next enemy. Go to the upper left of the section, then fall and dig left and jump left to reach the platform at the bottom left. You can now navigate the spiral of ladders and brick tunnels to pick up four more gold pieces. After that, go back out to the right, fall and walk over the enemy trapped at the bottom, to return to the right hand half of the play area. Head up the ladders to the upper right, then fall, digging right twice, to gather the last piece of gold. Repeat falling in the brick tunnel to the right and digging right to trap the enemy. Finally, escape via the right hand side of the play area.

Duplex Printing: These controls may be grayed out if your printer does not support duplex printing (i. e. printing on both sides of the sheet.) These controls are active if your printer supports duplex printing. You can choose from 3 alternatives: None. This prints each page of the job on one side of the sheets only. Long Side. This prints the job on both sides of the paper sheets. It prints the job in a way so that the backside has the same orientation as the front side if you fold the paper over the long edge. (Some printer drivers call this mode duplex-non-tumbled.) Short Side. This prints the job on both sides of the paper sheets. It prints the job so that the backside has the reverse orientation from the front side if you turn the paper over the long edge, but the same orientation, if you turn it over the short edge. (Some printer drivers name this mode duplex-tumbled.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o duplex=... # examples: "tumble" or "two-sided-short-edge"

If `lag' is 0, gnumeric recalculates all auto expressions immediately after every change. Non-zero values of `lag' allow gnumeric to accumulate more changes before each recalculation. If `lag' is positive, then whenever a change appears, gnumeric waits `lag' milliseconds and then recalculates; if more changes appear during that period, they are also processed at that time. If `lag' is negative, then recalculation happens only after a quiet period of BARlagBAR milliseconds.

In the text entry, enter one command per line, to control your boat. Commands supported are displayed between the two entry areas. The 'left' and 'right' commands must be followed by an angle in degrees. The angle value is also called a 'parameter' to the left or right command. By default 45 degrees is used. The 'forward' command accepts a distance parameter. By default 1 is used. For example: - left 90: Make a perpendicular left turn - forward 10: Go forward for 10 units (as displayed on the ruler). The goal is to reach the right of the screen (the red line). When done, you can try to improve your program and start a new race with the same weather conditions by using the retry button. You can click and drag your mouse anywhere on the map to get a measurement in distance and angle. Going to the next level will give you more complex weather conditions.

Messages sometimes come in both formats. This option controls whether you want the HTML part or the plain text part to be displayed. Displaying the HTML part makes the message look better, but at the same time increases the risk of security holes being exploited. Displaying the plain text part loses much of the message's formatting, but makes it almost impossible to exploit security holes in the HTML renderer (Konqueror). The option below guards against one common misuse of HTML messages, but it cannot guard against security issues that were not known at the time this version of KMail was written. It is therefore advisable to not prefer HTML to plain text. Note: You can set this option on a per-folder basis from the Folder menu of KMail's main window.
This dialog provides you with notification and details of scripting errors that occur on web pages. In many cases it is due to an error in the web site as designed by its author. In other cases it is the result of a programming error in Konqueror. If you suspect the former, please contact the webmaster of the site in question. Conversely if you suspect an error in Konqueror, please file a bug report at http: / /bugs. kde. org/. A test case which illustrates the problem will be appreciated.

If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this action.

Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\\ Just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\\ Right now, there are the following gestures available:\ move right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\ move left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\ move up and back down - Up (Alt+Up)\ circle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\\ The gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\\ Note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once. For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\\ The conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains'konqueror ').

One means of separating a mixture is to use distillation. In this setting, a distillation bridge acts as a conduit between the two pots. One pot contains the mixture to be separated, and through heating, a gas forms which is lead through the bridge. At the end of the bridge the gas phase is condensed and drips into a round flask. Typically, the bridge is cooled by return flow. Also, there is often a thermometer for controlling the temperature of the distillation bridge.

In the text entry, enter one command per line, to control your boat. Commands supported are displayed between the two entry areas. The 'left' and 'right' commands must be followed by an angle in degrees. The angle value is also called a 'parameter' to the left or right command. By default 45 degrees is used. The 'forward' command accepts a distance parameter. By default 1 is used. For example: - left 90: Make a perpendicular left turn - forward 10: Go forward for 10 units (as displayed on the ruler). The goal is to reach the right of the screen (the red line). When done, you can try to improve your program and start a new race with the same weather conditions by using the retry button. You can click and drag your mouse anywhere on the map to get a measurement in distance and angle. Going to the next level will give you more complex weather conditions.

Monitor Gamma This is a tool for changing monitor gamma correction. Use the four sliders to define the gamma correction either as a single value, or separately for the red, green and blue components. You may need to correct the brightness and contrast settings of your monitor for good results. The test images help you to find proper settings. You can save them system-wide to XF86Config (root access is required for that) or to your own KDE settings. On multi head systems you can correct the gamma values separately for all screens.

Thus, for a value of 500 tiles this usually means about 8 megabytes are used for image data. If you regularly handle large images, a greater value here might be useful. Note that this number is only a guideline for Krita, and is not guaranteed to be the actual number of tiles in memory.

After collecting all the gold on the left, stay over there, go up high, get the enemy to follow you, then drop to the floor. If an enemy falls near the middle ladder on the right, quickly climb to a point higher than that ladder. After a few tries, you should get all three enemies at the right onto the long rightmost ladder. Now it is easy to clear out the first two areas of gold on the right. Attract three or maybe only two enemies onto the middle ladder at the right. Go up near the hole in the concrete, drop, run right, go up the long ladder, drop left and collect the gold. If you get only two enemies onto the middle ladder, make sure the third one is dropping off the right ladder before you run across. You will then have to go all the way up the long ladder and wait till it is safe to drop left and collect the gold. If the enemies are still carrying gold, keep them chasing you around on the middle ladder and falling to the concrete until they release it.

Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn pipelining on.

If checked, the sky will remain focused on its current position or object as time passes. This is called "Tracking". Note that tracking is automatically engaged whenever an object is centered at the focus point. So, if you use "lookToward" with an object name, you do not need to engage tracking. If unchecked, then Tracking will be forced off, even if an object has been centered. As time passes, the sky will then appear to drift by (due to the rotation of the Earth).

Go left and fall on the gold, then go right to collect the next two pieces. Wait, high up on a pole at the far right of the play area, for the enemies to collect at the bottom right. Now go left and down and fall on the leftmost, bottom gold. Ignore the last gold for now, but go right and up along three poles and up three ladders. Step left off the third ladder while digging left, to prepare a trap for the enemy in the box on the left. Quickly go back down, fall on the last gold and prepare to move up and left in a hurry as a short hidden ladder appears below and to your left. The enemies swarm after you, but keep going till you get back to where you set the trap. The enemy should be in it now. Continue up and left over a short ladder, then down and left over long poles and ladders to the next short ladder. Go up and left again, then up and right over more long ladders and poles to the top of the screen.

The Black Point Compensation (BPC) feature works in conjunction with Relative Colorimetric Intent. With Perceptual Intent, it should make no difference, since BPC is always on, and with Absolute Colorimetric, Intent it is always turned off. BPC compensates for a lack of ICC profiles for rendering dark tones. With BPC the dark tones are optimally mapped (no clipping) from original the medium to the destination rendering medium, e. g. the combination of paper and ink.

The safest way to enter the building is to go down the top-left ladder and wait on top of the short ladder to the right. As an enemy approaches, run over him to the pole. Now go right and fall onto the balcony, then dig out and fall. Run into the lobby and up the ladder sculpture to get gold. Fall off to the left onto the concrete block and wait for the enemies to bunch up. Fall left and run back outside to the concrete outcropping with the enemies following. Use the same ladder and pole to get back in. Run to the very top of the building up the rightmost ladders. Stand at the leftmost point of the roof. Wait for an enemy to fall below you, then step back, dig and fall after him to the balcony, where you can collect three gold pieces. If you wait long enough on the roof before falling you can persuade several enemies to follow and become trapped on the balcony. Use the ladders on the right to collect the remaining gold and exit.

The factors of a number are all the numbers that divide that number evenly. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. 4 is not a factor of 6 because 6 cannot be divided into 4 equal pieces. If one number is a multiple of a second number, then the second number is a factor of the first number. You can think of multiples as families, and factors are the people in those families. So 1, 2, 3 and 6 all fit into the 6 family, but 4 belongs to another family. Use the arrow keys to navigate around the board and to avoid the Troggles. Press the spacebar to eat a number.

Use this to specify the performance of your connection. Note that you should select the speed of the weakest link - even if you have a high speed connection, it will not help you if the remote computer uses a slow modem. Choosing a level of quality that is too high on a slow link will cause slower response times. Choosing a lower quality will increase latencies in high speed connections and results in lower image quality, especially in'Low Quality 'mode.

This option specifies how much KWin will try to prevent unwanted focus stealing caused by unexpected activation of new windows. (Note: This feature does not work with the Focus Under Mouse or Focus Strictly Under Mouse focus policies.) None: Prevention is turned off and new windows always become activated. Low: Prevention is enabled; when some window does not have support for the underlying mechanism and KWin cannot reliably decide whether to activate the window or not, it will be activated. This setting may have both worse and better results than the medium level, depending on the applications. Medium: Prevention is enabled. High: New windows get activated only if no window is currently active or if they belong to the currently active application. This setting is probably not really usable when not using mouse focus policy. Extreme: All windows must be explicitly activated by the user. Windows that are prevented from stealing focus are marked as demanding attention, which by default means their taskbar entry will be highlighted. This can be changed in the Notifications control module.

Could not postpone message:
Unable to store a value at key, as the configuration server has no writable databases. There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped. If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help. If you have stale locks, remove ~/.gconf*/*lock. Perhaps the problem is that you attempted to use GConf from two machines at once, and ORBit still has its default configuration that prevents remote CORBA connections - put "ORBIIOPIPv4=1" in /etc/orbitrc. As always, check the user.* syslog for details on problems gconfd encountered. There can only be one gconfd per home directory, and it must own a lockfile in ~/.gconfd and also lockfiles in individual storage locations such as ~/.gconf

Message Disposition Notification Policy MDNs are a generalization of what is commonly called read receipt. The message author requests a disposition notification to be sent and the receiver's mail program generates a reply from which the author can learn what happened to his message. Common disposition types include displayed (i. e. read), deleted and dispatched (e. g. forwarded). The following options are available to control KMail's sending of MDNs: Ignore: Ignores any request for disposition notifications. No MDN will ever be sent automatically (recommended). Ask: Answers requests only after asking the user for permission. This way, you can send MDNs for selected messages while denying or ignoring them for others. Deny: Always sends a denied notification. This is only slightly better than always sending MDNs. The author will still know that the messages has been acted upon, he just cannot tell whether it was deleted or read etc. Always send: Always sends the requested disposition notification. That means that the author of the message gets to know when the message was acted upon and, in addition, what happened to it (displayed, deleted, etc.). This option is strongly discouraged, but since it makes much sense e. g. for customer relationship management, it has been made available.

Regular expression to find the type of the element. The pattern is searched on the result of the DefinitionRx match and the first captured area will hold the element type. Example (simplified): DefinitionRx=\\$+([a-zA-Z]+)=new\\\\s[a-zA-Z]+; TypeRx=new\\\\s([a-zA-Z]+); This will match strings like $fooObj=new foo;. Now this string is searched and it will find new foo;, where foo is the first captured text (the regular expression matching foo is between brackets). So the type of $fooObj is foo.

Well, it has been nice and easy up to now, but the game would be no fun without enemies. They are after the gold too: worse still they are after you! You die if they catch you, but maybe you will have a few lives left and can start again. You can handle enemies by running away, digging a hole or luring them into part of the playing area where they get stranded. If an enemy falls into a hole, he gives up any gold he is carrying, then gets stuck in the hole for a time and climbs out. If the hole closes while he is in it, he dies and reappears somewhere else on the screen. You can deliberately kill enemies by digging several holes in a row. More importantly, you can run over an enemy's head. You should do that right at the start of this level. Dig a hole, trap the enemy, wait for him to fall all the way in, then run over him, with the other enemy in hot pursuit... If you are feeling stressed, you can hit the Pause key at any time (default P or Esc) and take a break. Hit it again when you wish to continue.

Force Dump This forces a dump for a Callgrind profile run in the current directory. This action is checked while KCachegrind looks for the dump. If the dump is finished, it automatically reloads the current trace. If this is the one from the running Callgrind, the new created trace part will be loaded, too. Force dump creates a file'callgrind. cmd ', and checks every second for its existence. A running Callgrind will detect this file, dump a trace part, and delete'callgrind. cmd'. The deletion is detected by KCachegrind, and it does a Reload. If there is no Callgrind running, press'Force Dump 'again to cancel the dump request. This deletes'callgrind. cmd' itself and stops polling for a new dump. Note: A Callgrind run only detects existence of'callgrind. cmd 'when actively running a few milliseconds, i. e. not sleeping. Tip: For a profiled GUI program, you can awake Callgrind e. g. by resizing a window of the program.

Other LDAP servers will be used only if the connection to the "proxy" failed. The syntax is "HOST" or "HOST: PORT". If PORT is omitted, port 389 (standard LDAP port) is used.

The threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must move on the screen before acceleration has any effect. If the movement is smaller than the threshold, the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration was set to 1X; thus, when you make small movements with the physical device, there is no acceleration at all, giving you a greater degree of control over the mouse pointer. With larger movements of the physical device, you can move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.

This option enables some convenient features for saving files with extensions: Any extension specified in the  text area will be updated if you change the file type to save in. If no extension is specified in the  text area when you click Save,  will be added to the end of the filename (if the filename does not already exist). This extension is based on the file type that you have chosen to save in. If you do not want KDE to supply an extension for the filename, you can either turn this option off or you can suppress it by adding a period (.) to the end of the filename (the period will be automatically removed). If unsure, keep this option enabled as it makes your files more manageable.

A dehydrator is a piece of laboratory apparatus, often made of glass, and which serves to dry chemical matters; that is, to remove water or liquid from a sample. \t\t\tIn principle it is a glass bowl with cap that has a planar grinding, so that the bowl is air-tight. The dehydrator's lower part is ordinarily filled with a drying agent such as calcium chloride, silica gel, phosphoric anhydride or sulphuric acid. The sample to be dried is placed on a diaphanous cartridge of plastic or ceramic above the drying agent. \t\t\tThe drying agent is hygroscopic, which means that it dehumidifies its environment by absorbing water vapor. The dry atmosphere then takes up water from the sample to be dried.

Keys must be given an appropriate expiration date. For most people, the default option of "never expires" is sufficient. If you only plan on using the key for a certain period of time, i.e. for a specific project, you should pick an expiration date after the projected completion of your project. After the expiration date, your private key will still be able to decrypt messages or data encrypted with your public key. However, your private key will no longer sign messages or data.

- In the 'Boards' section you can change the list of activities. Just untoggle them in the treeview. You can change the language used for reading, for example, then the language used for saying the names of colors. - You can save multiple configurations, and switch between them easily. In the 'Profile' section add a profile, then in the 'Board' section select the profile in the combobox, then select the boards you want to be active. You can add multiple profiles, with different lists of boards, and different languages. You set the default profile in the 'Profile' section, by choosing the profile you want, then clicking on the 'Default' button. You can also choose a profile from the command line. - You can add users, classes and for each class, you can create groups of users. Note that you can import users from a comma-separated file. Assign one or more groups to a profile, after which those new logins will appear after restarting GCompris. Being able to identify individual children in GCompris means we can provide individual reports. It also recognizes the children as individuals; they can learn to type in and recognize their own usernames (login is configurable).

You may re-arrange the initial order of the list with the help of the arrow buttons on the right. The files will be printed as a single job, in the same order as displayed in the list. Note: You can select multiple files. The files may be in multiple locations. The files may be of multiple MIME types. The buttons on the right side let you add more files, remove already selected files from the list, re-order the list (by moving files up or down), and open files. If you open files, KDEPrint will use the application matching the MIME type of the file.

Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the "Require password" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's "Lock Session" action.

Detect recursive cycles If this is switched off, the treemap drawing will show black areas when a recursive call is made instead of drawing the recursion ad infinitum. Note that the size of black areas often will be wrong, as inside recursive cycles the cost of calls cannot be determined; the error is small, however, for false cycles (see documentation). The correct handling for cycles is to detect them and collapse all functions of a cycle into an artificial function, which is done when this option is selected. Unfortunately, with GUI applications, this often will lead to huge false cycles, making the analysis impossible; therefore, there is the option to switch this off.

Trap the first enemy immediately. Go up and right and hang on the ladder to the right of a short bar. As the enemy arrives, climb up quickly. As he reaches you again, go left, drop and go up the left hand ladder to the top. The enemy should head right, over the concrete, and fall. Now go down to the bottom left corner. The enemy should drop into a false brick next to the gold. Collect all gold at the top, then dig and drop to the next enemy. Stand on him, dig left and move right. The enemy will drop into the pit. Move to the right and collect more gold as you fall. Climb to the top, drop onto the trapped enemy via a false brick under a bar and collect five more nuggets. Now dig and go down the short ladder at the right of the bricks, to kill the enemy in the pit (who has more gold). He should reappear above you and fall through a false brick back into the pit. Dig three bricks between the two enemies and go down the short ladder until the enemies bunch up. Dig two more bricks to release them. Go up the ladder, over the concrete and, just before the enemies get up to the concrete, drop down to the floor and run to the bottom of the short ladder. The enemies should come down and run into the double pit on the right. Quickly run out to the right, over the enemies. Drop onto the last piece of gold, over on the right and the hidden ladders appear. Phew! P. S. Another way to trap the left hand enemy in the false brick is to get him to follow you up the leftmost ladder while you run across the top and dig to drop onto the second enemy. Timing is VERY tight. You must dig and drop before the enemy climbs over the top left and runs right. Later, climb the right hand ladders to the top, wait on the left hand bar over a false brick till the leftmost enemy starts to run towards you, then drop. Wait again till he starts to drop, then dig two bricks at the right of a short ladder, go right and drop, then run left to the bottom of a short ladder. The enemy should drop through a false brick and a ladder into the false brick beneath. P. P. S. There is no room for error or hesitation in this method! Not much in the first method either!

You can see some cards, but you can't see what's on the other side of them. Each card is hiding an operation, or the answer to it. In this game, these cards are hiding the two parts of an operation. You need to find the two parts of the operation, and bring them together again. Click on a card to see what number it's hiding, then try to find the other card that goes with it, to make a whole operation. You can only turn over two cards in one go, so you need to remember where the numbers are hiding, then you can match them when you find their other half. You're doing the job of the equals sign, and the numbers need you to put them together and make a proper equality. When you do that, both those cards disappear! When you've made them all disappear, found all the operations, you've won the game! :)

Here you can change the component program. Components are programs that handle basic tasks, like the terminal emulator, the text editor and the email client. Different KDE applications sometimes need to invoke a console emulator, send a mail or display some text. To do so consistently, these applications always call the same components. You can choose here which programs these components are.

Pages per Sheet: You can choose to print more than one page onto each sheet of paper. This is sometimes useful to save paper. Note 1: the page images get scaled down accordingly to print 2 or 4 pages per sheet. The page image does not get scaled if you print 1 page per sheet (the default setting). Note 2: If you select multiple pages per sheet here, the scaling and re-arranging is done by your printing system. However, some printers are independently capable of printing multiple pages per sheet. In which case you find the option in the printer driver settings. Be careful: if you enable multiple pages per sheet in both places, your printout will not look as you intended. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o number-up=... # examples: "2" or "4"

This selects which mailbox format will be the default for local folders: mbox: KMail's mail folders are represented by a single file each. Individual messages are separated from each other by a line starting with "From". This saves space on disk, but may be less robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders. maildir: KMail's mail folders are represented by real folders on disk. Individual messages are separate files. This may waste a bit of space on disk, but should be more robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders.

The image may have more colors than the current screen mode can support. In order to display it, some color information may be removed. If you save this image, any color loss will become permanent. To avoid this issue, increase your screen depth to at least bpp and then restart KolourPaint. It also contains translucency which is not fully supported. The translucency data will be approximated with a 1-bit transparency mask. If you save this image, this loss of translucency will become permanent.

Satisfy (Satisfy) This directive controls whether all specified conditions must be satisfied to allow access to the resource. If set to "all", then all authentication and access control conditions must be satisfied to allow access. Setting Satisfy to "any" allows a user to gain access if the authentication or access control requirements are satisfied. For example, you might require authentication for remote access, but allow local access without authentication. The default is "all".

Choose the style for your font for the currently selected cells.

Changing to Roman for example will change all the selected cells style text to Roman.
Here you can see the currently configured file name schemes which the "Suggest" button in the tag editor uses to extract tag information from a file name. Each string may contain one of the following placeholders: %t: Title %a: Artist %A: Album %T: Track %c: Comment For example, the file name scheme "[%T] %a - %t" would match "[01] Deep Purple - Smoke on the water" but not "(Deep Purple) Smoke on the water". For that second name, you would use the scheme "(%a) %t". Note that the order in which the schemes appear in the list is relevant, since the tag guesser will go through the list from the top to the bottom, and use the first matching scheme.
The multiples of a number are all the numbers that are equal to the original number times another number. For example, 24, 36, 48 and 60 are all multiples of 12. 25 is not a multiple of 12 because there isn't any number that can be multiplied by 12 to get 25. If one number is a factor of a second number, then the second number is a multiple of the first number. Again, you can think of multiples as families, and factors are the people who belong to those families. The factor 5, has parents 10, grandparents 15, great-grandparents 20, great-great-grandparents 25, and every extra step of 5 is another great- in front! But the number 5 does not belong in the 8 or 23 families. You can't fit any number of 5s into 8 or 23 with nothing left over. So '8 isn't a multiple of 5, nor is 23. Only 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 ... are multiples (or families or steps) of 5. Use the arrow keys to navigate around the board and to avoid the Troggles. Press the spacebar to eat a number.

The Ionic Radius is the radius of a charged atom, known as an ion. The ion can have a positive or a negative charge. The charge of the ion with the radius shown is also displayed in Kalzium. A positive ion has fewer electrons in its shell than the atom, a negative ion has more electrons. Therefore, a positive ion has a smaller radius than its atom and vice versa.

Printers The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). Although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems, KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and filtering tasks, especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the administrative tasks (adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, etc.) What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily dependent on your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern printing, the KDE Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system.

Font size for label
This option forces a specific DPI value for fonts. It may be useful when the real DPI of the hardware is not detected properly and it is also often misused when poor quality fonts are used that do not look well with DPI values other than 96 or 120 DPI. The use of this option is generally discouraged. For selecting proper DPI value a better option is explicitly configuring it for the whole X server if possible (e. g. DisplaySize in xorg. conf or adding -dpi value to ServerLocalArgs= in $KDEDIR/ share/ config/ kdm/ kdmrc). When fonts do not render properly with real DPI value better fonts should be used or configuration of font hinting should be checked.

Go left, dig two holes to trap them, then run right, dig and fall to the bottom of the first small ladder on the right. The enemies should come down the long ladder and fill up the two false bricks at its foot. Dig and catch the third enemy on top of the thick brick area, then run to the second space from the bottom of the long ladder, next to a row of bricks. The enemy should run into the pits on the left.

Peter W. composed this in 1985. Do you see the prophetic letters GR? Spooky! When you collect the row of gold at bottom left, wait there and the first enemy will obligingly fall into the pit above you. When you move over to the right side, collect all nuggets except the three hanging under a ladder. Leave them till last. To get the gold above the trapped enemy, climb the ladder, dig down four bricks, wait till they start to re-appear, then dig one more, climb back up, re-dig the first two and the way will be clear to fall in, collect the gold and escape over the enemy's head. When you release the enemy, retreat quickly to where you can trap and kill him. After one or two tries he will re-appear harmlessly over on the left.

No wdelay This option only has effect if sync is also set. The NFS server will normally delay committing a write request to disk slightly if it suspects that another related write request may be in progress or may arrive soon. This allows multiple write requests to be committed to disk with the one operation which can improve performance. If an NFS server received mainly small unrelated requests, this behavior could actually reduce performance, so no wdelay is available to turn it off.

If this is disabled, then gFTP will open up a port on the client side and the remote server will attempt to connect to it.

Draws quasiperiodic tilings; think of the implications on modern formica technology. In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper. Penrose said he does n't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken." As reported by News of the Weird #491, 4-Jul-1997. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Penrosetiling Written by Timo Korvola; 1997.

This is an exercise in moving around. Follow the track of gold nuggets until the ladder pops up at the right. The hero can only follow the mouse along simple paths (like  BAR L or U), so be careful not to get too far ahead of him. DANGER: Try not to fall off the ladder or bar into the concrete pit at the bottom right. If you do get trapped there, the only way out is to kill the hero (press key Q for quit) and start the level again.

First Chamber. Dig down to collect the top left piece of gold. Fall onto the enemies to get the gold on the right. Dodge them to pick up the rest. Trap the enemies high on the right while you dig out through the bottom of the chamber. As you emerge, you must drop straight onto the ladder next to the concrete. Climb down that ladder, under the concrete to the right and then up to the top of the next chamber. Second Chamber. Proceed left to right with the shafts, using your digging skills to get the gold. On the rightmost shaft, dig left while falling, then fall left while digging both left and right. In the three-brick platform now remaining, dig the left brick, then the right and the center while falling right. Pick up the gold on the right and fall onto the last gold piece while digging left. Dig left again, fall onto the ladder next to the concrete, as before, and go on up to the next chamber. Third Chamber. Dig right, fall on the left gold piece and immediately dig right to trap the enemy, then dig and exit left. Repeat, one brick over, for the gold piece on the right. Now go back to the top and fall into the lower section, on top of the enemy. Take the short pole left and step across the falling enemy to grab the long pole going left. Fall on the gold, dig to trap the enemy, dig again and exit left. Repeat for the other hanging gold piece. This time dig down and out, onto the ladder next to the concrete, and so to the last chamber. Fourth Chamber. Trap the enemy, run to the top, dig through to the concrete on the left, wait for the enemy and fall on him to get at more gold on the left. When all the gold in this chamber is gone, run to the bottom and fall through to the floor. Now pick up the rest of the gold and get out quick.

Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Qt Designer uses Ctrl+F4 for closing windows. In KDE, however, Ctrl+F4 is the shortcut for going to virtual desktop 4, so this shortcut does not work in QT Designer. Further, Qt Designer does not use KDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the window.\\ This problem can be solved by remapping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when the active window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl+W is pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other applications, the effect of Ctrl+W is unchanged.\\ We now need to specify three things: A new shortcut trigger on'Ctrl+W', a new keyboard input action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the active window is Qt Designer.\ Qt Designer seems to always have title'Qt Designer by Trolltech ', so the condition will check for the active window having that title.

Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or any other KDE application using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer from a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. You might, for example want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie or simply reject or accept everything. For example, you might choose to accept all cookies from your favorite shopping web site. For this all you have to do is either browse to that particular site and when you are presented with the cookie dialog box, click on This domain under the'apply to' tab and choose accept or simply specify the name of the site in the Domain Specific Policy tab and set it to accept. This enables you to receive cookies from trusted web sites without being asked every time KDE receives a cookie.

Browser Identification The browser-identification module allows you to have full control over how Konqueror will identify itself to web sites you browse. This ability to fake identification is necessary because some web sites do not display properly when they detect that they are not talking to current versions of either Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, even if the browser actually supports all the necessary features to render those pages properly. For such sites, you can use this feature to try to browse them. Please understand that this might not always work, since such sites might be using non-standard web protocols and or specifications. NOTE: To obtain specific help on a particular section of the dialog box, simply click on the quick help button on the window title bar, then click on the section for which you are seeking help.

You can see a set of cards that all look the same. 
Each card has a picture on the other side, and each picture has a twin somewhere in the set. 
You can only turn over two cards at once, so you need to remember where the pictures are until you can find the twin. 
When you turn over twins, they disappear! 
You take turns with Tux, and to win the game, you have to find more pairs of twins than he does.
