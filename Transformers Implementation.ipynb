    "## MultiHeadAttention\n",
    "\n",
    "Here comes the most important mechanism that powers whole the LLM industry, **attention** \n",
    "\n",
    "Attention in general refers to focus on some specific section of words while ignoring others. Attention is used to understand the context of a word in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of self-attention is to utilize the entire sequence to compute a weighted average of each token's embedding instead of relying on a fixed embedding for each token like word2vec. Embeddings that are generated this way are called contextualized embeddings. This can be restated as self-attention generating a new sequence of embeddings $x_1', \\ldots, x_n'$ when given a sequence of token embeddings $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$, where each new embedding $x_i'$ is a linear combination of all the $x_j$ in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_i' = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ji} x_j$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients $w_{ji}$ are called attention weights and are normalized so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ji} = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the magic of paying attention is enabled by these attention weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s consider these two sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I love cool, crisp fall weather.\n",
    "    Don’t fall on your way to the gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The word fall in the first sentence denotes weather by looking at words like cool and crips whereas fall in the second sentence denotes actually falling by looking at words like way and gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss how we construct attention weights and the final embedding representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaled dot-product attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaled Dot-Product Attention is used to calculate the attention weights.\n",
    "The first step in calculating self-attention is to project three vectors from each of the encoder’s input vectors (in this case, token embeddings). So for each word, we project three matrices,  𝑄,𝐾,𝑉  and which are called Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector and each has a dimension of  𝑑𝑘 . \n",
    "\n",
    "These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process.\n",
    "The dot product acts as a similarity function which determines how much the query and key vectors relate to each other. If queries and keys are similar, they will result in a significant dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is calculated as a weighted sum of the values, with each value's weight determined by the query's compatibility function with its corresponding key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the final weights on the values, first, the dot product of the query with all keys is computed and then normalized by $\\sqrt{d_{k}}$. Then a softmax function is applied. Finally, $V$ is multiplied with the previous output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Attention(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that the softmax reweights between 0 and 1 (kind of like probability for each word), which sums upto 1 for all the words. So, multiplying this probability with $V$ determines the contribution of each word against each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't understand the how we calculate the attention weights and the final embedding representation then, let's understand this with the help of an analogy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to make something to eat for dinner. But you don't know how to. But you've got a Recepie book that tells you what ingredients to use let the Recepie book be our QUERY, now you go to a supermarket to buy these recepies, the ingredients the supermarket has in their shelves is the KEY, and now you look at your recepie book and ingredients in the shelves to find how similar they are, which becomes our attention weights. Now that you've found how similar these ingredients are, you update your shopping cart based on the similarity, which is, multiplying the attention weights with VALUES. That's it Now you have your ingredient, which is the embedding representation which will be used for Language modeling later."
